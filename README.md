### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Alex, and I am a highly motivated Computer Science graduand student with a passion for Data Science and Machine Learning. I approach problem-solving with persistence and a methodical mindset, continuously seeking to expand my knowledge.

Currently, I am working on my thesis project which involves the development of a Domestic Electricity Forecasting System using Machine Learning techniques. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a practical solution that can have a positive impact.
