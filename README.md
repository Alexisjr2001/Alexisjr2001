# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexandros Tsingos (Αλέξανδρος Τσίγγος)
- ⚡ I am a highly motivated **Computer Science graduate** from **Aristotle University Of Thessaloniki** in Greece, with a passion for **Data Science and Machine Learning**. I approach problem-solving with **persistence and a methodical mindset**, continuously seeking to **expand my knowledge**.

- 🔭 I have successfully completed my **thesis project**, which involved developing a **Domestic Electricity Forecasting System using Machine Learning techniques**, and I am now seeking new avenues to further expand upon this work.

- 😄 In my free time, I enjoy playing sports such as football, basketball, swimming, and cycling. I also practice Byzantine music regularly. I am passionate about volunteering and have served as a Team Leader at summer camps and taught at an Orthodox Sunday School.
